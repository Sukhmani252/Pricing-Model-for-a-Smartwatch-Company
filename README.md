## Problem : 

- NuWave, a startup dealing in a wide range of electronic gadgets and accessories wants to launch a new smartwatch, which will be one of their flagship products. 
- They plan to launch the watch with an OLED display.
- They intend to first enter the market and gain at least 5% of the market share.
- As a new player in the smartwatch market, they want to price the watch lower than their competition (selling at ₹ 7,799).
- To achieve 5% of the market share, NuWave needs to sell at least 1,800 units per day. Assume NuWave can completely fulfill the demand for the day.

## Complication :
- For NuWave to sell 1,800 smartwatches a day, they need to have a certain level of inventory.
- Each smartwatch requires one OLED panel. For smooth production, they need to have its stock as well.
- NuWave can store only 2000 OLED panels in their own facility. To store more, they need a warehouse, which will cost them ₹ 12,000/day. They can store 10,000 OLED panel units in one warehouse.
- The warehouse should not be underutilized.

## Task :
To build a spreadsheet model to find out the selling price of one smartwatch so that:

- NuWave can gain a 5% market share.
- Earn at least a 2% profit margin.

## Approach :
- The relationship between order quantity and the price of the OLED panels is calculated.
